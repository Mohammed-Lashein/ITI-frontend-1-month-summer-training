# Final Project -- A very Basic Ecommerce website

I like ecommerce projects because they have a lot of details and require good structure. But since time wasn't on my side, there were no time to build a complex structure.  

Also, I am a fan of small commits, but I will create some non-small commits for this project for the aforementioned reason.  
I created a prototype for the project since some days ago, and I am going to copy paste the code here.  
Why didn't I write the code here in the first place?  
-> There is a good piece of advice from Code Complete book regarding this topic, but since I don't have time(again?) to go search for it, I will paraphrase it myself from what I remember:  
> When you want to try some functionality or new code, make sure you try it in a non-production environment. If you try the code in a production environment or you convince yourself that this code will be shipped later, you won't experiment with it sufficiently since you don't want to break things.

What if you need to see a good project structure?  
You can check out the [vanilla js version of the library project](../library-project/). It has some very nice structure and implementation of **Domain Model** (partially), **Factory** and **Data Mapper** Design patterns.
