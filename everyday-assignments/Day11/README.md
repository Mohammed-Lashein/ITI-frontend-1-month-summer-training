# Bootstrap assignment 1

- .container-{breakpoint}: width is `100%` until the specified breakpoint.
- horizontal padding is called a **gutter**

After looking carefully into the designs, to make them using bootstrap grid system (which uses flexbox internally), it will be both impractical and time consuming.  

We should return to the old days of absolute positioning and tinkering with float to achieve the required design.  

CSS grid is for 2-dimentional designs (like the one we have).  
So instead of fighting bootstrap grid and bear the burden of choosing the wrong tool, I will try to make these designs using css grid instead.
