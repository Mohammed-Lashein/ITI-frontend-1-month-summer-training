# Library project

This project is really fantastic!
I like the solution by [the amazing engineer michalosman](https://github.com/michalosman/library) which has nice naming conventions and the code is well structured so that beginners can follow along.

I was learning design patterns like factory and data mapper, so I tried to implement these.
I would say that I was bragging with adding real world structure to a small application that won't need this separation of concerns at all, but consider it as an introduction to design patterns in a non-advanced way.
