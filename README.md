# ITI assignments projects
This is a collection of the projects required in the assignments of the 1 month frontend path in ITI.

I have to say that I am not happy with some details in the projects. A lot of features could have been implemented better. At least some unit tests should be present.

But I don't have time for so due to the deadlines.
I will try to write comprehensible code, but at the same time there is a room for improvements.
